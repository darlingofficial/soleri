title: 'Customizing Your Agent'
description: 'Shape your agent''s identity, add domains, configure hooks, and make it truly yours.'
---

Your agent ships with a default personality and starter knowledge. But the real power comes from making it yours — tuning its identity, adding domains that match your work, and setting up hooks that enforce your standards automatically.

## Identity and persona

Your agent has a persona — a name, role, and communication style. This isn't cosmetic. The persona shapes how the agent frames its responses, what it emphasizes, and how it communicates.

> **You:** "What's your identity?"
> **Agent:** _Name: sentinel. Role: security-focused code review assistant. Voice: direct, technical, no-nonsense._

You set the persona during scaffold, but you can change it anytime:

> **You:** "Update your role to: full-stack development assistant focused on React and Node.js"
> **Agent:** _Identity updated. Role changed._

### Behavioral guidelines

Guidelines are rules the agent follows in every interaction. They shape behavior beyond the persona:

> **You:** "Add this guideline: always suggest TypeScript strict mode when reviewing tsconfig changes"
> **Agent:** _Guideline added._

Guidelines stack with vault knowledge. The vault has what to do; guidelines control how the agent approaches work.

## Adding domains

Domains are expertise areas. Each domain gets its own search partition and facade with 5 operations. Start with what you need and add more as your work evolves:

```bash
npx @soleri/cli add-domain infrastructure
npx @soleri/cli add-domain testing
npx @soleri/cli add-domain performance
```

After adding a domain, seed it with knowledge:

```bash
npx @soleri/cli install-knowledge ./bundles/infrastructure-patterns
```

Or capture knowledge interactively:

> **You:** "Capture a critical pattern in the infrastructure domain: always set CPU and memory limits on Kubernetes pods."
> **Agent:** _Captured in infrastructure domain._

### Choosing domains

Good domains are knowledge areas where you accumulate reusable patterns:

| Good domains | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| `security` | Clear rules, critical patterns, compliance requirements |
| `frontend` | Component conventions, accessibility standards, design tokens |
| `api-design` | Endpoint conventions, error formats, versioning rules |
| `testing` | Test patterns, coverage standards, mocking approaches |
| `infrastructure` | Deployment, scaling, monitoring patterns |

Avoid domains that are too broad ("coding") or too narrow ("button-styles"). You want enough specificity that searches return relevant results, but enough breadth that the domain accumulates useful knowledge.

## Hooks

Hooks are quality gates that run automatically during development. They catch common mistakes in real time — before they reach your codebase.

### Installing hooks

```bash
npx @soleri/cli hooks add-pack full
```

This installs all available hooks:

| Hook | What it catches |
|------|----------------|
| `no-console-log` | Leftover debug statements |
| `no-any-types` | TypeScript `any` usage |
| `no-important` | CSS `!important` declarations |
| `no-inline-styles` | Inline `style=` attributes |
| `semantic-html` | Non-semantic HTML elements |
| `focus-ring-required` | Missing keyboard focus indicators |
| `ux-touch-targets` | Touch targets smaller than 44px |
| `no-ai-attribution` | AI attribution in commit messages |

### Editor integration

```bash
npx @soleri/cli hooks add claude-code    # Claude Code
npx @soleri/cli hooks add cursor         # Cursor
```

Hooks run as pre-tool-use checks in your editor. When the agent is about to write code that violates a hook, the hook blocks it and explains why.

## Knowledge packs

Knowledge packs are bundles of pre-built expertise you can install:

```bash
npx @soleri/cli install-knowledge <path-or-package>
```

A pack contains typed entries — patterns, anti-patterns, principles, workflows — organized by domain. After installing, the entries are available in your vault immediately.

### Available tiers

| Tier | Source | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| **Starter** | Ships with every agent | Free |
| **Community** | npm registry | Free |

The starter pack gives your agent useful knowledge from day one. Community packs extend it with domain-specific expertise contributed by other developers.

## Governance policies

Control how strictly knowledge enters your vault:

```bash
npx @soleri/cli governance --preset strict      # All captures require approval
npx @soleri/cli governance --preset moderate    # Auto-approve suggestions, review critical
npx @soleri/cli governance --preset permissive  # Auto-approve everything
```

Governance controls:
- **Quotas** — maximum entries per domain or type
- **Retention** — how long unused entries survive before decay
- **Auto-capture** — which severity levels auto-approve vs require proposal review

Start with `moderate` — it balances quality with convenience. Move to `strict` if your team has many contributors and you want to review every new pattern before it becomes active.
