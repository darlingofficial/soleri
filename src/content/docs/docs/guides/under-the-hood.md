Your Soleri agent is an MCP tool server. It runs locally, stores everything in files on your machine, and exposes tools that Claude Code calls when needed. This page explains how each piece works so you can trust what's happening.

## Your agent is a tool server

When Claude Code starts, it launches your agent as a child process. The agent registers its tools — search, capture, plan, and 160+ others — over the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Claude Code decides when to call these tools based on your conversation. When you ask "what do we know about error handling?", Claude Code recognizes this as a knowledge question and calls the agent's `search_intelligent` tool. The agent returns ranked results, and Claude Code uses them in its response.

The agent never acts on its own. It responds to tool calls from Claude Code — nothing more.

## The vault

The vault is a SQLite database with FTS5 (full-text search) enabled. It stores knowledge entries — patterns, anti-patterns, rules, playbooks — as structured records.

Each entry has:
- **Type** — pattern, anti-pattern, rule, playbook, workflow, principle, reference
- **Domain** — the knowledge area (frontend, security, infrastructure, or your custom domains)
- **Severity** — critical, warning, or suggestion
- **Tags** — free-form labels for discovery
- **Description** — the actual knowledge, in your words

The vault file lives in your agent's data directory. It's a regular SQLite file — you can inspect it with any SQLite client if you're curious.

### How search works

When Claude Code calls the search tool, the agent doesn't just do a keyword match. It combines six signals into a single relevance score:

| Signal | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **TF-IDF text relevance** | How well the query matches the entry's text — weighted by term rarity |
| **Severity weight** | Critical entries get a boost over suggestions |
| **Recency** | Recently added or modified entries rank slightly higher |
| **Tag overlap** | Entries whose tags match the query context score higher |
| **Domain match** | Entries in the matching domain get a boost |
| **Usage history** | Entries that have been useful before rank higher over time |

This is why a critical security pattern about JWT storage outranks a suggestion about loading spinners when you search for "authentication" — even if both mention tokens.

## The brain

The brain is the intelligence layer that sits on top of the vault. It tracks which patterns actually work and uses that information to improve recommendations.

### Pattern strength

Every vault entry has a strength score tracked by the brain. Strength increases when:
- The pattern is found in a search and used in work
- A plan that included this pattern completes successfully
- You give positive feedback on a search result

Strength decreases when:
- The pattern is found but dismissed
- Plans that used the pattern have high drift (things didn't go as planned)
- The entry goes unused for a long period (decay)

### TF-IDF vocabulary

The brain maintains a TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) index across all vault entries. This is what makes search smart — it knows that "authentication" is more meaningful than "the" and ranks accordingly.

The index rebuilds automatically when you add entries. You can trigger a manual rebuild after bulk imports.

### Recommendations

When the agent creates a plan, it asks the brain: "what patterns are relevant to this task?" The brain returns recommendations ranked by strength. A pattern with strength 0.9 (proven across many successful sessions) gets recommended more confidently than one with strength 0.3 (untested).

These recommendations appear as decisions in the plan — the agent tells you what it knows before you start working.

### Knowledge extraction

After a plan completes, the brain examines the session: what tools were used, what files were modified, how long it took, whether the outcome matched the plan. If it detects a reusable pattern, it extracts it back into the vault.

This is the automatic part of the compound loop — you don't have to manually capture everything. The brain finds patterns in your work and proposes them.

## Memory and persistence

Everything your agent knows persists in files:
- **Vault** — SQLite database with knowledge entries
- **Brain state** — JSON file with strength scores, session history, TF-IDF vocabulary
- **Plans** — JSON file with plan history and reconciliation reports
- **Config** — your agent's identity, domains, and settings

When you close Claude Code and open it again, nothing is lost. The agent loads its state from these files and picks up exactly where it left off.

### Cross-project knowledge

If you work on multiple projects, you can link them:

```
"Link this project to my-other-project as related"
```

Linked projects can search each other's vaults. A security pattern you captured in one project becomes discoverable in another.

You can also promote high-value patterns to a global pool — available to every agent you run, across all projects.

## Governance

Not everything you capture goes straight into the vault. The governance layer evaluates each capture:

- **Quotas** — prevent the vault from growing without bounds
- **Proposal gates** — certain entry types require approval before becoming active
- **Duplicate detection** — if a similar entry already exists, the capture may be rejected or merged

This keeps the vault clean and useful over time. Without governance, knowledge bases tend to accumulate noise — duplicates, contradictions, entries nobody needs.

## The curator

The curator is an automated maintenance system that keeps vault quality high:

- **Deduplication** — finds entries that say the same thing and proposes merging them
- **Decay scanning** — identifies entries that haven't been used in a long time
- **Health audits** — reports on overall vault quality: duplicate rate, staleness, gaps
- **Tag normalization** — cleans up inconsistent tags across entries

You can run curator operations manually, or let them happen as part of the brain's lifecycle.
