Every AI session starts from zero. You explain your conventions, your architecture, your preferences — and then the session ends and it's all gone. You do it again tomorrow. And the day after that. The assistant never gets better, never remembers, never grows.

**We believe AI assistants should compound knowledge, not lose it.**

Soleri is the open-source engine that makes that real.

## How It Works

Soleri gives agents persistent infrastructure — a **vault** that remembers, a **brain** that learns, and **memory** that carries across every project and conversation. Knowledge flows through a lifecycle: **capture** from real sessions → **store** with domain classification → **strengthen** through confidence scoring → **compound** by surfacing what works first.

Instead of one generic assistant, you build specialized **agents** — each with its own voice, expertise, and growing knowledge base — all running on a shared engine. The more you use them, the sharper they get.

## What You Get

```bash
npm install -g soleri

soleri create my-agent       # Create an agent with starter knowledge
soleri list                  # Show registered agents
soleri update                # Update to latest templates
soleri doctor                # Check system health
```

Your agent ships with starter knowledge and auto-captures patterns from your codebase on first run.

### The Engine

**Vault** — Domain-separated knowledge store. Patterns, anti-patterns, workflows, and architecture decisions organized by domain (frontend, backend, cross-cutting), vectorized with [Cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee) for semantic search and graph-connected for cross-domain discovery. Self-maintaining: deduplication, decay detection, and confidence tracking happen automatically.

**Brain** — Learning loop that captures intelligence from real sessions. Tracks pattern strength with confidence scores, surfaces high-confidence patterns first, and operates on a rolling window. No manual tagging — capture is automatic.

**Memory** — Cross-session, cross-project continuity. Switch conversations, switch projects — nothing is lost. Link projects as related, parent/child, or fork and search across all of them with weighted relevance.

**Playbooks** — Multi-step validated procedures stored in the vault. Token migrations, component setup, contrast audits — each step includes validation criteria so the agent can execute and verify autonomously.

### Your Agent

Soleri is an agent forge. You create specialized agents — each with its own persona, domain expertise, and growing vault — all running on a shared engine.

```bash
soleri create my-agent       # Forge a new agent
```

Give it a name, a domain, a voice. It ships with starter knowledge and learns from every session.

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agents         yours · your team's · community          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Domains        design · security · architecture · ...  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Engine         vault · brain · planning · memory       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Transports     MCP (Claude Code) · REST · LSP          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Engine** — Pure logic, zero protocol dependencies. Single process, no config bloat.
- **Transports** — MCP for Claude Code and Cursor today, REST and LSP designed into the architecture.
- **Domains** — Pluggable expertise modules (frontend, backend, cross-cutting, and custom).
- **Vault Backends** — Three-tier model: agent vault (personal), project vault (team conventions), team vault (shared across all projects). Local filesystem, git sync, or remote API.
- **Model-agnostic** — The engine runs on pure SQLite FTS5 and TF-IDF math. Works without API keys for local vault search, pattern matching, and brain tracking.

### Knowledge Packs

Install expertise in one command:

| Tier | Source | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| **Starter** | Ships with agent | Free |
| **Community** | npm registry | Free |
| **Premium** | Subscription | Paid |

```bash
soleri packs install community/react-patterns
soleri packs sync
```

### Teams & Ops

- **Connected vaults** — Link agent, project, and team vaults with automatic search priority.
- **Cross-project knowledge** — Link projects and search across them with weighted relevance.
- **Health checks** — `soleri doctor` reports engine version, domain status, vault health, brain tracking, and team sync state.
