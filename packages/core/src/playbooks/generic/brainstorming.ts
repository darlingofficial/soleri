  title: 'Brainstorming — Design Before Code',
  trigger:
    'Use when the request is creative, ambiguous, or involves building something new. Activates before any implementation work.',
  description:
    'Structured design exploration before writing any code. The agent explores context, asks clarifying questions, proposes 2-3 approaches with trade-offs, and presents the design for approval. No code is written until the design is approved.',
  steps: `1. EXPLORE CONTEXT
   - What exists? Read relevant code, docs, prior art
   - What constraints apply? Tech stack, patterns, conventions
   - What's been tried before? Search vault for related patterns

2. ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
   - Surface assumptions that could derail implementation
   - Ask about edge cases, error handling, user expectations
   - Ask about scope boundaries — what's explicitly NOT included

3. PROPOSE 2-3 APPROACHES
   - Each approach with clear trade-offs (complexity, performance, maintainability)
   - Recommend one with rationale
   - Wait for user feedback before proceeding

4. PRESENT DESIGN IN SECTIONS
   - Break design into chunks short enough to read and digest
   - Architecture, data flow, API surface, error handling, testing strategy
   - Get approval on each section before moving to next

5. WRITE DESIGN DOCUMENT
   - Save approved design to docs/ or vault
   - Include decisions and rationale

HARD GATE: No implementation code until design is approved.`,
  expectedOutcome:
    'A clear, approved design document that eliminates ambiguity. Implementation follows a known path. Decisions are documented with rationale.',
