    'Use when intent is BUILD or FIX and implementation involves writing new code or modifying existing behavior.',
  description:
    'Enforces the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle: write a failing test first, implement minimal code to pass it, then refactor. No production code exists without a test that demanded it.',
  steps: `1. RED — Write the test first
   - Write a test that describes the desired behavior
   - Run it and watch it FAIL (read the actual output)
   - If it passes without new code, the test is wrong or the feature already exists

2. GREEN — Write minimal code to pass
   - Write the simplest implementation that makes the test pass
   - Do NOT write more code than the test demands
   - Run the test and watch it PASS (read the actual output)

3. REFACTOR — Clean up while green
   - Improve structure, naming, duplication — without changing behavior
   - Run tests after every change — they must stay green
   - Commit when clean

4. REPEAT — Next behavior, next test
   - Each cycle should take 2-5 minutes
   - If a cycle takes longer, the step is too big — break it down

IRON LAW: If you wrote production code before the test, DELETE IT and start over.`,
