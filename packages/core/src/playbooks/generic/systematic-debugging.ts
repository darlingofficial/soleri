  description:
    'Four-phase root cause analysis: gather evidence, analyze patterns, form and test hypotheses, then implement the minimal fix. No fix is applied without first understanding WHY the bug exists.',
  steps: `1. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
   - Reproduce the bug reliably (exact steps, exact output)
   - Trace backward: symptom -> immediate cause -> original trigger
   - Read the actual error output — do not guess from the description
   - Search vault for similar bugs and their root causes

2. PATTERN ANALYSIS
   - Is this a known pattern? (race condition, stale cache, off-by-one, null ref)
   - Has this module had bugs before? Check git history
   - Map the failure boundary: what works, what doesn't

3. HYPOTHESIS TESTING
   - Form 1-3 specific hypotheses about the root cause
   - For each: predict what you'd see if this hypothesis is correct
   - Test each prediction with the smallest possible experiment
   - One hypothesis at a time — don't combine changes

4. MINIMAL FIX
   - Fix the root cause, not the symptom
   - Write a test that reproduces the bug FIRST (RED)
   - Apply the smallest change that fixes it (GREEN)
   - Verify no regressions (run full test suite)
   - If 3+ fixes fail: stop and question the architecture

IRON LAW: No fix without root cause understanding.`,
