  description:
    'Every completion claim must be backed by evidence: run the command, read the output, only then assert the result. No self-reported success.',
  steps: `1. IDENTIFY VERIFICATION COMMANDS
   - What commands prove this works? (test runner, build, lint, type check)
   - What manual checks are needed? (UI renders, API responds, file exists)
   - What acceptance criteria need evidence?

2. RUN EACH COMMAND
   - Execute each verification command
   - READ THE ACTUAL OUTPUT (not just the exit code)
   - If any command fails: the task is NOT complete

3. COLLECT EVIDENCE
   - For each claim, record the command and its output
   - "Tests pass" -> show the test runner output
   - "Build succeeds" -> show the build output

4. VERIFY AGAINST ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
   - Check each acceptance criterion against collected evidence
   - Mark each as: VERIFIED (with evidence) or UNVERIFIED
   - If any criterion is UNVERIFIED: the task is NOT complete`,
  expectedOutcome:
    'Every completion claim is backed by command output evidence. No ambiguity about whether the work is actually done.',
