# Knowledge Harvest — Extract Patterns From Anything

Point at code, docs, PRs, architecture decisions, postmortems, or any text — the agent reads it, extracts every pattern, anti-pattern, decision, and principle, then captures them all to the vault. Zero-friction knowledge population.

## When to Use

- "Learn from this file" / "Extract patterns from this codebase"
- "Read our architecture doc and capture everything"
- "Harvest knowledge from this PR"
- "Ingest this post-mortem"
- Populating a fresh vault with existing team knowledge

## The Magic: Automated Knowledge Extraction

### Step 1: Understand the Source

Read the target content (code, docs, etc.) and classify what type of knowledge it contains:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:route_intent
  params: { prompt: "Extract knowledge from: <source description>" }
```

### Step 2: Check What's Already Known

Before extracting, search the vault to avoid duplicates:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:search_intelligent
  params: { query: "<topic of the source material>" }
```

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_tags
```

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_domains
```

This tells you what the vault already covers — focus extraction on gaps.

### Step 3: Extract and Classify

Read through the source material and identify:

| Type | What to Look For |
|------|-----------------|
| **pattern** | "We always do X because Y" — repeatable approaches |
| **anti-pattern** | "Don't do X because Y" — known mistakes |
| **decision** | "We chose X over Y because Z" — architectural choices |
| **principle** | "We believe X" — guiding rules |
| **workflow** | "The process for X is: step 1, step 2..." — procedures |

For each extracted item, determine:
- **Category**: Which domain it belongs to
- **Severity**: critical / warning / suggestion
- **Tags**: Searchable keywords

### Step 4: Batch Capture

For each extracted item, capture to the vault:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:capture_knowledge
  params: {
    title: "<clear, searchable name>",
    description: "<what it is, when to apply, why it matters>",
    type: "<pattern|anti-pattern|decision|principle|workflow>",
    category: "<domain>",
    tags: ["<tag1>", "<tag2>"],
    severity: "<critical|warning|suggestion>",
    example: "<code snippet or quote from source>",
    why: "<reasoning>"
  }
```

Present each capture to the user as you go:
```
Captured: api-auth-jwt (pattern, critical)
  → "Use short-lived JWTs for authentication"
  Auto-tags: auth, jwt, security
```

### Step 5: Post-Harvest Quality

After all items captured, run quality checks:

**Detect any duplicates created during harvest:**
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_detect_duplicates
```

**Groom all new entries — normalize tags, fix metadata:**
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_groom_all
```

**Enrich entries with additional context:**
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_enrich
  params: { entryId: "<id>" }
```

**Check for contradictions with existing knowledge:**
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_contradictions
```

### Step 6: Verify Harvest Results

Check vault health after the harvest:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_health
```

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_vault_analytics
```

Present a summary:
```
## Harvest Complete

Source: [file/doc name]
Extracted: X entries
  - Y patterns
  - Z anti-patterns
  - W decisions
  - V principles

Duplicates found: N (merged/skipped)
Contradictions found: N (flagged for review)
Vault health: OK
```

### Step 7: Promote Universal Patterns (Optional)

If any extracted patterns apply across projects:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_promote_to_global
  params: { entryId: "<id>" }
```

## The Magic

This feels like magic because the user points at a 50-page architecture doc and says "learn from this" — and 2 minutes later, the vault has 30 classified, tagged, searchable patterns that inform every future conversation. The agent didn't just read the doc — it understood it, classified it, deduplicated it, and made it permanent.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Start with your team's top 10 decisions** — the ones people keep asking about
- **Feed postmortems** — they're goldmines of anti-patterns
- **Feed architecture decision records (ADRs)** — pure decision captures
- **Feed code review comments** — patterns that reviewers enforce repeatedly
- **Feed onboarding docs** — principles that new team members need to learn
