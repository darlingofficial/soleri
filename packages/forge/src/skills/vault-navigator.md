# Vault Navigator — Knowledge Oracle

Navigate the vault intelligently. The vault has multiple search strategies — this skill picks the right one based on what the user needs.

## When to Use

Any time the user wants to find existing knowledge before building something new. Also when asking about best practices, previous solutions, or patterns.

## Search Strategy Decision Tree

### For "Have we seen this before?" / "Best practice for X"

Start with `YOUR_AGENT_core op:search_intelligent` — this is semantic search, the broadest and smartest query. Pass the user's question as the query.

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:search_intelligent
  params: { query: "<user's question>" }
```

If results are weak (low scores or few matches), fall back to `YOUR_AGENT_core op:search` with explicit filters (type, category, tags, severity). This is structured search — narrower but more precise.

### For "Show me everything about X" (Exploration)

Use tag-based and domain-based browsing for broader exploration:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_tags
```

Lists all tags in the vault — helps discover what topics are covered.

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_domains
```

Lists all domains — shows the knowledge landscape at a glance.

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_recent
```

Shows recently added or modified entries — what's fresh in the vault.

### For "What's stale?" / "What needs updating?"

Run an age report to find outdated knowledge:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_age_report
```

Present entries that haven't been updated recently — these are candidates for review, refresh, or removal.

### For "What do other projects do?"

Call `YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_cross_project_search` with `crossProject: true`. This searches across all linked projects, not just the current one.

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_cross_project_search
  params: { query: "<topic>", crossProject: true }
```

Check what projects are linked:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:project_linked_projects
```

### For "Has brain learned anything about X?"

Call `YOUR_AGENT_core op:brain_strengths` to see which patterns have proven strength. Then call `YOUR_AGENT_core op:brain_global_patterns` with a domain or tag filter to find cross-project patterns.

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:brain_strengths
YOUR_AGENT_core op:brain_global_patterns
  params: { domain: "<domain>" }
```

### For "What do I know about X?" (broad exploration)

Chain multiple strategies for comprehensive results:

1. `search_intelligent` → semantic vault search
2. `vault_tags` / `vault_domains` → browse knowledge landscape
3. `memory_cross_project_search` → cross-project patterns
4. `brain_strengths` → proven patterns

Present all findings with source labels so the user knows where each insight came from.

## Presenting Results

Always include:

- **Source**: Which search found it (vault, memory, brain, tags, domains)
- **Confidence**: Score or strength rating
- **Relevance**: Why this result matches the query
- **Actionable next step**: How to apply this knowledge

## Fallback: Web Search

If all vault strategies return no results, search the web for the user's question before saying "nothing found." The web may have:

- Documentation, articles, or guides on the topic
- Community patterns and best practices
- Library-specific solutions

If web search finds something useful, offer to capture it to the vault:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:capture_quick
  params: {
    title: "<what was found>",
    description: "<summary from web search, source URL>"
  }
```

## Exit Criteria

Search is complete when at least one search strategy has been tried and results presented. If no results found across all strategies (vault + web), say so explicitly — that's valuable information too (it means this is genuinely new territory worth exploring and capturing).
