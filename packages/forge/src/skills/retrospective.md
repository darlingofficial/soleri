# Retrospective — Learning Report From Real Data

Generate a retrospective from actual session data, vault captures, plan outcomes, and brain intelligence. Not opinions — data-driven reflection on what happened, what worked, what didn't, and what to do differently.

## When to Use

- End of sprint / week / month
- "What did I learn this week?"
- "Sprint retrospective"
- "What went well? What didn't?"
- After completing a major feature or milestone

## The Magic: Data-Driven Reflection

### Step 1: Gather the Data

**Brain stats — the big picture:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:brain_stats
```

**Recent brain stats — compare velocity:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:brain_stats
  params: { since: "<start of period>" }
```

**Pattern strengths — what's proven:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:brain_strengths
```

**Recent vault captures — what was learned:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_recent
```

**Memory topics — where knowledge clusters:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_topics
```

**Memory stats — volume and health:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_stats
```

**Plan stats — execution track record:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:plan_stats
```

**Loop history — iterative workflow outcomes:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:loop_history
```

**Search insights — what people looked for but didn't find:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_search_insights
```

**Vault analytics — knowledge quality:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_vault_analytics
```

### Step 2: Analyze Patterns

**Stale knowledge needing refresh:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_age_report
```

**Duplicates that crept in:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_detect_duplicates
```

**Contradictions in the knowledge base:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_contradictions
```

**Curator health audit — overall quality:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_health_audit
```

### Step 3: Present the Retrospective

```
## Retrospective: [Period]

### By the Numbers
| Metric | This Period | Previous | Trend |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Patterns captured | X | Y | ↑/↓ |
| Anti-patterns logged | X | Y | ↑/↓ |
| Plans completed | X | Y | ↑/↓ |
| Brain strength (avg) | X | Y | ↑/↓ |
| Vault entries total | X | — | — |
| Search misses | X | Y | ↑/↓ |

### What Went Well
[Patterns with high brain strength, completed plans, growing domains]

### What Didn't Go Well
[Recurring anti-patterns, failed plans, search misses = knowledge gaps]

### Strongest Patterns
[Top 5 patterns by brain strength — these are your superpowers]

### Recurring Anti-Patterns
[Top 3 anti-patterns that keep appearing — these need systemic fixes]

### Knowledge Gaps
[Domains with low coverage, frequent search misses, stale entries]

### Vault Health
- Quality score: X/100
- Duplicates found: N
- Contradictions found: N
- Stale entries (>30 days): N

### Recommendations
1. [Action item based on data]
2. [Action item based on data]
3. [Action item based on data]
```

### Step 4: Capture the Retrospective

Save the retrospective itself as knowledge:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:capture_knowledge
  params: {
    title: "Retrospective — [period]",
    description: "<key findings and action items>",
    type: "workflow",
    category: "meta",
    tags: ["retrospective", "<period>"]
  }
```

### Step 5: Clean Up (Optional)

If the retrospective revealed quality issues, offer to fix them:

**Consolidate vault (deduplicate, normalize, groom):**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_consolidate
```

**Rebuild brain intelligence with fresh data:**

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:brain_build_intelligence
```

## The Magic

This feels like magic because the user says "sprint retro" and gets a data-driven report they didn't have to compile. It's not AI making up observations — it's actual metrics from their vault, brain, plans, and memory. The recommendations come from real gaps, not generic advice.
