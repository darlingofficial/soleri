# Health Check — Knowledge Base Maintenance

Run a comprehensive maintenance cycle on the knowledge base. Finds stale entries, duplicates, contradictions, quality issues, and fixes them. Like a doctor's checkup for your knowledge.

## When to Use

- Weekly/monthly maintenance ritual
- "Is my vault healthy?"
- "Clean up my knowledge base"
- Before a retrospective (clean data = better insights)
- After a knowledge harvest (post-ingest quality check)

## The Magic: Comprehensive Quality Audit

### Step 1: System Health

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_health
```

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_diagnostic
```

Catches infrastructure issues — database corruption, stale caches, configuration problems.

### Step 2: Vault Metrics

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_vault_size
```

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_vault_analytics
```

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_domains
```

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_tags
```

Shows the big picture: how many entries, which domains, tag distribution.

### Step 3: Quality Audit

Run the curator's health audit — the most comprehensive quality check:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_health_audit
```

This checks: tag normalization, description quality, severity distribution, domain coverage balance, and overall vault quality score.

### Step 4: Find Duplicates

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_detect_duplicates
```

Present duplicates for review. Offer to merge or remove them.

### Step 5: Find Contradictions

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_contradictions
```

Contradictions are entries that give conflicting advice. Present each pair for the user to resolve:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_resolve_contradiction
  params: { contradictionId: "<id>" }
```

### Step 6: Find Stale Entries

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:vault_age_report
```

Entries older than 30 days without updates are candidates for:
- Refresh (still relevant, needs updating)
- Archive (no longer relevant)
- Delete (incorrect or superseded)

### Step 7: Check Search Quality

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_search_insights
```

Shows what people search for but don't find — these are knowledge gaps that should be filled.

### Step 8: Memory Health

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_stats
```

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_deduplicate
```

Clean up duplicate memories.

### Step 9: Governance Queue

Check if any proposals are pending review:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:governance_proposals
  params: { action: "list" }
```

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:governance_stats
```

Expire stale proposals:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:governance_expire
```

### Step 10: Fix Everything (Optional)

If the user approves, run the full cleanup:

**Groom all entries — normalize tags, fix metadata:**
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_groom_all
```

**Full consolidation — deduplicate, normalize, quality-score:**
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_consolidate
```

**Prune stale memory:**
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_prune
```

**Rebuild brain intelligence with clean data:**
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:brain_build_intelligence
```

**Reset caches to pick up changes:**
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_reset_cache
```

## The Magic

This feels like magic because knowledge bases normally decay silently — duplicates accumulate, entries go stale, contradictions creep in, gaps grow. This skill makes decay visible and fixable in one command. It's like having a librarian who does a weekly audit of every book on every shelf.
