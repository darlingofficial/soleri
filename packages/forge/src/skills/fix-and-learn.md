# Fix & Learn — Debug, Repair, Capture

Fix bugs through a structured recovery workflow, then capture the root cause as a reusable anti-pattern. The learning step is what makes fixes compound across sessions.

## When to Use

Any time something is broken, behaving unexpectedly, or producing errors. This includes runtime bugs, visual regressions, type errors, and "it used to work" situations.

## The Search Order — MANDATORY

**Never jump to writing code.** Always follow this lookup order:

1. **Vault first** — has this been solved before?
2. **Web search** — is there a known solution or pattern?
3. **Plan the fix** — design the approach before touching code
4. **Implement** — only after steps 1-3

Skipping to implementation is the #1 cause of wasted time and recurring bugs.

## Orchestration Sequence

### Step 1: Classify and Route

Classify the intent to confirm this is a FIX and get routing context:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:route_intent
  params: { prompt: "<user's bug description>" }
```

### Step 2: Check Vault First

Search for this bug or similar issues:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:search_intelligent
  params: { query: "<error message or bug description>" }
```

Check memory for patterns across sessions:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_search
  params: { query: "<bug description>" }
```

Check memory topics — are bugs clustering in a specific area?

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_topics
```

Check memory stats to understand the debugging landscape:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:memory_stats
```

If vault returns a match with high confidence — **use it**. Don't re-investigate what's already been solved.

### Step 3: Search the Web

If the vault has no answer, search for existing solutions before investigating from scratch:
- Known issues in the library/framework
- Stack Overflow answers for the exact error
- GitHub issues on relevant repos
- Official documentation for the API or feature involved

A 30-second web search can save hours of investigation.

### Step 4: Start Fix Loop

For complex bugs requiring multiple iterations, start a validation loop:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:loop_start
  params: { prompt: "Fix: <bug description>", mode: "custom" }
```

### Step 5: Diagnose and Fix

Only if Steps 2-3 didn't produce a solution, apply the systematic debugging approach (use systematic-debugging skill):
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Isolate the root cause
3. **Plan the fix before writing code** — even a one-line mental plan
4. Implement the fix
5. Verify the fix resolves the issue without regressions

Track each iteration:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:loop_iterate
```

### Step 6: Validate the Fix

Run the project's test suite to ensure the fix didn't introduce regressions. Use the verification-before-completion skill to confirm all checks pass.

Complete the loop when validated:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:loop_complete
```

### Step 7: Capture the Learning

This step is critical — it's what makes the agent smarter over time.

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:capture_knowledge
  params: {
    title: "<bug title>",
    description: "<root cause, solution, what made it hard to find>",
    type: "anti-pattern",
    category: "<domain>",
    tags: ["<error-type>", "<component>"]
  }
```

For quick captures:
```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:capture_quick
  params: { title: "<bug>", description: "<root cause and fix>" }
```

### Step 8: Post-Capture Quality

Run duplicate detection to ensure we didn't create redundant entries:

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:curator_detect_duplicates
```

### Step 9: Verify Health

```
YOUR_AGENT_core op:admin_health
```

## Exit Criteria

Fix is complete when: the bug is resolved, tests pass (Step 6), and the root cause is captured in vault (Step 7). A fix without a capture is an incomplete fix.
